# Changelog

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- Realtime toast notifications for shower and laundry bookings — when a checkin user books a slot on one device, staff users viewing the services page see an immediate toast (e.g. "John Doe was signed up for Shower at 9:00 AM") with lucide-react icons (ShowerHead, WashingMachine). Uses preferred name when available, falls back to first + last name.
- `resolveGuestName()` helper in `useRealtimeSync` for guest name lookup from the Zustand store.
- 7 new tests covering: INSERT notifications for showers/laundry, preferred name resolution, UPDATE/DELETE suppression, unknown guest fallback, and absent slot time handling.
