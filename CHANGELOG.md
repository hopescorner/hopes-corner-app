# Changelog

## [0.5.21] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- Multi-day notes: daily notes can now span a date range via a "Multi-day note" toggle in the modal, with start/end date pickers and validation. Range notes automatically appear on all intermediate dates. Useful for equipment outages or multi-day events.
- 6 new tests covering range-aware getters (getNotesForDate, getNotesForDateRange, hasNoteForDateAndService).
- Database migration adding nullable `note_end_date` column with check constraint.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- Realtime toast notifications for shower and laundry bookings — when a checkin user books a slot on one device, staff users viewing the services page see an immediate toast (e.g. "John Doe was signed up for Shower at 9:00 AM") with lucide-react icons (ShowerHead, WashingMachine). Uses preferred name when available, falls back to first + last name.
- `resolveGuestName()` helper in `useRealtimeSync` for guest name lookup from the Zustand store.
- 7 new tests covering: INSERT notifications for showers/laundry, preferred name resolution, UPDATE/DELETE suppression, unknown guest fallback, and absent slot time handling.
